						<p>I run a women in tech group. I read articles everyday. I research about why more women aren't in tech. I research how to GET more women in tech. I hear about programs doing amazing things. My social medias feeds are finely honed to put anything relevant on my radar. I want to give you all that information to use to help understand why there's a lack of diversity in tech, but more importantly, how you can help.</p>
						<p>History of women in programming. Today programming is very male-dominated, and wild theories that women aren't as adept at math and science fly rampant. Clearly this didn't use to be the case. We'll talk about some women who pioneered the industry.</p>

							&ldquo;The more I study, the more insatiable do I feel my genius for it to be.&rdquo;
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Though computers didn't technically exist at the time, Ada Lovelace is credited with being a pioneer of computer science. She wrote the first algorithm in history, which theoretically would calculate numbers on the Analytical Engine. Ada described how to use punch cards to enter number. She was a revoluntionary thought leader with the foresight of what computers COULD do, and understanding of the possibilities that entailed. Her predictions indcludes the use of computers to create music and graphics, and have scientific uses.</p>

						<blockquote cite="http://womenshistory.about.com/od/quotes/a/grace_hopper.htm">
							&ldquo;The most dangerous phrase in the language is, "We've always done it this way.&rdquo;
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>There's a conference named after her for good reason. Grace Hopper was a Vassar College graduate with a BA in mathematics and physics, and upon entering the Navy became the 3rd person to program the Mark 1 computer. Working with computers, Grace theorized more people(read: non-mathmeticians) would be able to use them if they were able to be interacted with an a more humanized, readable way. She created what may be considered the first compiler: FLOW-MATIC, intended to complete tasks like billing and payroll based on english commands. She continued to advocate for human readable programming languages and was paramount in creating validation tools and internation standards for programming languages.</p>
							<p>It was hard picking a quote from her, she was a serious badass and said a lot of things that are 100% relevant today</p>

						<h2>Erna Schnieder Hoover</h2>
						<img src="images/erna_hoover.png" />
						<blockquote cite="http://mentalfloss.com/article/53181/inspiring-quotes-10-influential-women-tech">
							&ldquo;I designed the executive program for handling situations when there are too many calls, to keep it operating efficiently without hanging up on itself. Basically it was designed to keep the machine from throwing up its hands and going berserk.&rdquo;
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>You may not have heard of Erna Schnieder Hoover, but you may as well call her the mother of telecommunications. Erna was a mathmetician, who when working at Bell Labs, invented the stored program control system, which was one of the first software patents ever recieved. </p>
							<p>In the 1950's, when you went to make a phone call, an operator would ask you what number you could like to call, and manually connect you using a switchboard and array of cords, plugs, and switches. Large numbers of incomming calls would overload the switchboards being manually answered by phone operators. </p>
							<p>Erna's invention was a computer system that monitored incoming call rates and automatically adjusted call's acceptance rate, largely eliminating overloading problems. This was the first of many computer programs Erna created to improve and maintain the quality of telecom services Bell provided.  </p>
							<p>Interesting note, Erna's husband, Charles Wilson Hoover, Jr., was extremely supportive of her career, though that was the opposite of desired wife behavior in the 1950's.</p>

						<h2>What Happened?</h2>
						<img src="images/1984.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>So we've highlighten some women rocking out in tech well into the 1950's. Computer science programs started popping up in university all over the country, including Columbia, Cambridge, and Harvard. And women are enrolling in them. </p>
							<p>Then, in 1984 we seea steep decline in women enrolling in computer science. What the heck happened?</p>

					<section id="computersmarketed">
						<h2>Computers for homes were produced ... and only marketed to boys</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>In the 1990s, Jane Margolis, a researcher, interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University, one of the first universities to implement a computer science program. The research showed that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.</p>
							<p>Why was this a problem? Because as personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home, and suddenly women who didn't grow up playing on computers were expected to know things that the boys who were given computers did.</p>

						<h2>The Trouble With Bright Girls</h2>
						<img src="images/girl.jpg" alt="">
						
						<div class="fragment">
							<p>&ldquo;Bright girls believe that their abilities are innate and unchangeable, while bright boys believe that they can develop ability through effort and practice.&rdquo;</p>
							<small><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-success/201101/the-trouble-bright-girls">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-success/201101/the-trouble-bright-girls</a></small>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>One of the best articles I've ever read is called "The Trouble with Bright Girls". The article discusses the research of psychologist Carol Dweck, who investigated how bright 5th grade boys and girls handled difficult and confusing new material. The results were troubling - the higher the girl's IQ, the more quickly she gave up, where as boys were energized by the challenge and would increase their efforts.</p>
							<p>Bright girls believe that their abilities are innate and unchangeable, while bright boys believe that they can develop ability through effort and practice.</p>
							<p>The likely cause is the way they have been spoken to as children. Girls mature more quickly, are more discipline, and feedback praises them for being good, well-behaved, pretty, intelligent. Boys, who are often more rambunctious are encouraged to "try harder", instead of being praised for already attained skills. </p>
							<p>This feedback loop is dangeruos, because girls believe their attributes they are praised for are innate, therefor unable to change. Boys, on the otherhand learn to simply work harder.</p> <p>This article BLEW MY MIND. I was a bright girl. I was praised for my intelligence. I breezed through AP level courses, and wasn't challenged until I got to college. I began flunking econ, was constantly bawling on the phone to my mother about my own incompetence, unable to understand why I wasn't smart enough.</p>
							<p>Technology is a very intelligent field, filled with very intelligent people. Except most of those people are men, and as a women who's been praised for intelligence instead of the ability to improve, it's easy to fall prey to the idea that we're not smart enough to be there.</p>

							<p>Women in leadership roles is a no-brainer. However, do not interprut this as put "any women in a leadership role". This will do more harm than good. Instead pay attention to women who may have leadership potential but don't bring it to your attention in the ways you'd expect. Men are more likely to boast their achievements that make them promotion-worthy, and women are more likely to be quiet and humble in regards to theirs. I'll talk about the book Lean In later, but it explains this phenomenon at great length.</p>
